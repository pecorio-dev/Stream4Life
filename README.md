## About the Developer

Hi, I'm **Clément Thollier**, a 17-year-old self-taught developer and high school student in my final year (1ère CIEL) at Lycée Parc de Vilgénis, France (2024-2025). My journey into web and mobile development began a few years ago with a curiosity about how websites and apps are built. What started as a hobby quickly grew into a passion as I dove into **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **Python**, **PHP**, **Kotlin**, and **Java** through online tutorials and personal projects.

Stream4Life is a solo project that reflects my dedication to learning and building practical solutions. Over time, I've honed my skills in Android development, mastering concepts like View Binding, Room database, Coroutines, and RecyclerView to create this app. This project is not just about code—it's about solving real-world problems and creating something meaningful for users.
